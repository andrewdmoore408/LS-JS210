There are at least 3 issues here: There should be spaces between the variable names, operators, and values; template strings should be used instead of concatenating with +; and the lines in the function body are indented way too far (should just be two spaces in).

Updated:

function read(pages) {
  console.log('You started reading.');

  for (let page = 0; page < pages; page += 1) {
    let message = `You read page ${page}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}

read(400);
